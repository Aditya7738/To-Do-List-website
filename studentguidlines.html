				<h2>Guidlines to add tasks in Task-Table</h2>
		</center><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">I created this special Task-Table which was inspired by The Eisenhower Matrix.
		Dwight Eisenhower who was 34<sup>th</sup> president of United States.<br>
		In his lifetime, Eisenhower accomplished a lot and sustained high productivity for many years until his death. Nowadays, his methods of productivity have been studied extensively and used successfully by top performing entrepreneurs, professionals, athletes, artists and so on.<br><br>
		His best-known technique, the Eisenhower Matrix, is a simple, powerful tool that will help you to better prioritize your tasks—distinguish between what is important and urgent—and boost your productivity today.<br><br>Here’s how it works.<br><br></p>
		<h3>The Eisenhower Matrix</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">“The most urgent decisions are rarely the most important ones.”<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp—Dwight Eisenhower<br><br>
		The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as Urgent-Important Matrix, consists of four quadrants that help you to decide on and prioritize tasks by urgency and importance.<br><br>
		The four quadrants of the Eisenhower Matrix are as follows:<br><br></p>
		<center><img src="images/Eisenhower Decision Matirx.jpeg"></center><br><br>
		<h3>Quadrant 1: Urgent and important</h3><br><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Tasks in this box of the Eisenhower matrix include deadlines, crises and problems that require your immediate attention and are also important for achieving your goals.
		For examples., complete journal, practicals, assignments and so on.</p><br><br>
		<h3>Quadrant 2: Important but not urgent</h3><br><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Tasks in this quadrant don’t have a deadline round the corner, but they are important for achieving your goals. For examples., exercising, studying, family time.<br>
		Ideally, we should spend majority of our time on tasks in this box</p><br><br>
		<h3>Quadrant 3: Urgent but not important</h3><br><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Activities in this box of the Eisenhower matrix are generally urgent interruptions that don’t help us to achieve our goals. For examples., phone calls or messages from friends, family.<br><br>
		User may be confuse while entering task in this box because it can often deceptively appear to be quadrant 1 task.<br><br>
		They also give us a sense of achievement and satisfaction from crossing them off our to-do list, when in reality we haven’t made much progress.</p><br><br>
		<h3>Quadrant 4: Not important and not urgent</h3><br><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Tasks in this box of the Eisenhower matrix are typically time-wasting activities that don’t help you to achieve your long-term goals. For examples., Mindlessly browsing through social media, surfing the web, playing video games and watching TV.<br><br>
		If we’re being honest, we often spend the majority of our time on activities in this box. What has worked for me isn’t necessarily eliminating activities in this box, but instead minimizing and using them as a reward for my productive hours during the day.
